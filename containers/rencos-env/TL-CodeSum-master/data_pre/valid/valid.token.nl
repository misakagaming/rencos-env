135144	this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : < p > items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . < p > there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . < p > the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .

28773	this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : < p > items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . < p > there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . < p > the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .

19453	the start configuration for simplex is built from a box parallel to the canonical axes of the space . the simplex is the subset of vertices of a box parallel to the canonical axes . it is built as the path followed while traveling from one vertex of the box to the diagonally opposite vertex moving only along the box edges . the first vertex of the box will be located at the start point of the optimization . as an example , in dimension 3 a simplex has 4 vertices . setting the steps to ( 1 , 10 , 2 ) and the start point to ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) would imply the start simplex would be : { ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 11 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 11 , 3 ) } . the first vertex would be set to the start point at ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) and the last vertex would be set to the diagonally opposite vertex at ( 2 , 11 , 3 ) .

18910	returns node holding key or null if no such , clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way . repeatedly traverses at base - level looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findpredecessor , processing base - level deletions as encountered . some callers rely on this side - effect of clearing deleted nodes . restarts occur , at traversal step centered on node n , if : ( 1 ) after reading n ' s next field , n is no longer assumed predecessor b ' s current successor , which means that we don ' t have a consistent 3 - node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered . ( 2 ) n ' s value field is null , indicating n is deleted , in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying . even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn ' t require restart , they aren ' t sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting . ( 3 ) n is a marker or n ' s predecessor ' s value field is null , indicating ( among other possibilities ) that findpredecessor returned a deleted node . we can ' t unlink the node because we don ' t know its predecessor , so rely on another call to findpredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor , which it will do . this check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop , ( and the b . value check isn ' t strictly needed at all ) but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links , and so will retry anyway . the traversal loops in doput , doremove , and findnear all include the same three kinds of checks . and specialized versions appear in findfirst , and findlast and their variants . they can ' t easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed .

57517	main worker run loop . repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them , while coping with a number of issues : 1 . we may start out with an initial task , in which case we don ' t need to get the first one . otherwise , as long as pool is running , we get tasks from gettask . if it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters . other exits result from exception throws in external code , in which case completedabruptly holds , which usually leads processworkerexit to replace this thread . 2 . before running any task , the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing , and then we ensure that unless pool is stopping , this thread does not have its interrupt set . 3 . each task run is preceded by a call to beforeexecute , which might throw an exception , in which case we cause thread to die ( breaking loop with completedabruptly true ) without processing the task . 4 . assuming beforeexecute completes normally , we run the task , gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterexecute . we separately handle runtimeexception , error ( both of which the specs guarantee that we trap ) and arbitrary throwables . because we cannot rethrow throwables within runnable . run , we wrap them within errors on the way out ( to the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler ) . any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die . 5 . after task . run completes , we call afterexecute , which may also throw an exception , which will also cause thread to die . according to jls sec 14 . 20 , this exception is the one that will be in effect even if task . run throws . the net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterexecute and the thread ' s uncaughtexceptionhandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code .
