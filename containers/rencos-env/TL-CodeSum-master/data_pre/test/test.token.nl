44179	it ' s tricky with this implementation because we can ' t rely on any state in between two calls to setcharacter since the caller might modify the terminal ' s state outside of this writer . however , many calls inside textgraphics will indeed make multiple calls in setcharacter where we know that the state won ' t change ( actually , we can ' t be 100 % sure since the caller might create a separate thread and maliciously write directly to the terminal while call one of the draw / fill / put methods in here ) . we could just set the state before writing every single character but that would be inefficient . rather , we keep a counter of if we are inside an ' atomic ' ( meaning we know multiple calls to setcharacter will have the same state ) . some drawing methods call other drawing methods internally for their implementation so that ' s why this is implemented with an integer value instead of a boolean ; when the counter reaches zero we remove the memory of what state the terminal is in .

' will they differ . because the rest of the encoding is the same we can do comparisons without extracting the run length and because of our earlier inversion trick , the highest run length duplicates will appear first . so we take those and ignore any that follow with the same idx ' .

105164	indicates whether the native implementation should proceed with a pending , native focus request . before changing the focus at the native level , the awt implementation should always call this function for permission . this function will reject the request if a duplicate request preceded it , or if the specified heavyweight component already owns the focus and no native focus changes are pending . otherwise , the request will be approved and the focus request list will be updated so that , if necessary , the proper descendant will be focused when the corresponding focus_gained event on the heavyweight is received . an implementation must ensure that calls to this method and native focus changes are atomic . if this is not guaranteed , then the ordering of the focus request list may be incorrect , leading to errors in the type - ahead mechanism . typically this is accomplished by only calling this function from the native event pumping thread , or by holding a global , native lock during invocation .

3390	dom level 1 did not have a standard mechanism for creating a new document object . this function provides a dom - implementation - independent abstraction for that for that concept . it ' s typically used when outputting a new dom as the result of an operation . < p > todo : this isn ' t directly compatable with dom level 2 . the level 2 createdocument call also creates the root element , and thus requires that you know what that element will be before creating the document . we should think about whether we want to change this code , and the callers , so we can use the dom ' s own method . ( it ' s also possible that dom level 3 may relax this sequence , but you may give up some intelligence in the dom by doing so ; the intent was that knowing the document type and root element might let the dom automatically switch to a specialized subclass for particular kinds of documents . )

106466	given a set of schedulables and a number of slots , compute their weighted fair shares . the min shares and demands of the schedulables are assumed to be set beforehand . we compute the fairest possible allocation of shares to the schedulables that respects their min shares and demands . to understand what this method does , we must first define what weighted fair sharing means in the presence of minimum shares and demands . if there were no minimum shares and every schedulable had an infinite demand ( i . e . could launch infinitely many tasks ) , then weighted fair sharing would be achieved if the ratio of slotsassigned / weight was equal for each schedulable and all slots were assigned . minimum shares and demands add two further twists : - some schedulables may not have enough tasks to fill all their share . - some schedulables may have a min share higher than their assigned share . to deal with these possibilities , we define an assignment of slots as being fair if there exists a ratio r such that : - schedulables s where s . demand < r * s . weight are assigned share s . demand - schedulables s where s . minshare > r * s . weight are given share s . minshare - all other schedulables s are assigned share r * s . weight - the sum of all the shares is totalslots . we call r the weight - to - slots ratio because it converts a schedulable ' s weight to the number of slots it is assigned . we compute a fair allocation by finding a suitable weight - to - slot ratio r . to do this , we use binary search . given a ratio r , we compute the number of slots that would be used in total with this ratio ( the sum of the shares computed using the conditions above ) . if this number of slots is less than totalslots , then r is too small and more slots could be assigned . if the number of slots is more than totalslots , then r is too large . we begin the binary search with a lower bound on r of 0 ( which means that all schedulables are only given their minshare ) and an upper bound computed to be large enough that too many slots are given ( by doubling r until we either use more than totalslots slots or we fulfill all jobs ' demands ) . the helper method slotsusedwithweighttoslotratio computes the total number of slots used with a given value of r . the running time of this algorithm is linear in the number of schedulables , because slotsusedwithweighttoslotratio is linear - time and the number of iterations of binary search is a constant ( dependent on desired precision ) .

107010	this method determines which menu items get to be ' action items ' that will appear in an action bar and which items should be ' overflow items ' in a secondary menu . the rules are as follows : < p > items are considered for inclusion in the order specified within the menu . there is a limit of mmaxactionitems as a total count , optionally including the overflow menu button itself . this is a soft limit ; if an item shares a group id with an item previously included as an action item , the new item will stay with its group and become an action item itself even if it breaks the max item count limit . this is done to limit the conceptual complexity of the items presented within an action bar . only a few unrelated concepts should be presented to the user in this space , and groups are treated as a single concept . < p > there is also a hard limit of consumed measurable space : mactionwidthlimit . this limit may be broken by a single item that exceeds the remaining space , but no further items may be added . if an item that is part of a group cannot fit within the remaining measured width , the entire group will be demoted to overflow . this is done to ensure room for navigation and other affordances in the action bar as well as reduce general ui clutter . < p > the space freed by demoting a full group cannot be consumed by future menu items . once items begin to overflow , all future items become overflow items as well . this is to avoid inadvertent reordering that may break the app ' s intended design .
